# Pulley Backup Configuration Example
#
# Global configs: Place in ~/.config/pulley/*.toml for shared jobs
#                 Examples: personal.toml, servers.toml, work.toml
#
# Local configs:  Place in the current directory as *.pulley.toml
#                 Examples: project.pulley.toml, home.pulley.toml
#
# Multiple config files are supported and merged alphabetically.
# Local jobs override global jobs with matching IDs.
